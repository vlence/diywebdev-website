	<h1>
		A Brief History of The Web.
	</h1>

	<p class="mt-10">
		We've all used computers and are very grateful for them. They're fast
        and do exactly what they're told (programmed) to do. A single computer today
        is able to browse the internet, play music and video games, write
        documents, all at the same time. It wasn't always so.
	</p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        When computers were first made they were designed to do only one thing.
        If you built a computer that could add two numbers, we call this a program, it could only ever
        add two numbers. These computers were massive and often took up entire
        rooms of space. They were very expensive too. Over time clever people
        figured out how to make a computer do more than just one thing until
        we finally had general purpose computers. General purpose computers like
        the computers you have at home and your phone are able to run different
        programs.
    </p>

	<h2 class="mt-20">
		Networking.
	</h2>

	<p class="mt-10">
		Once computers became general purpose they also became more useful. Now
        anyone, not just computer scientists, could use computers. An interesting
        fact about this time in history is that computers usually came with a
        manual that taught you how to program it. So if you bought a computer
        back then you also learned computer programming. This meant if you needed
        to do something, like edit a picture, and there wasn't a program already
        for it you could write it yourself. Interesting right?
	</p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        Computers back then weren't very fast compared to today's computers but
        they were still fast enough to be useful. Then somebody came up with an
        idea - what if we could connect computers together and have them communicate?
        If computers can communicate then you could program them to share their
        workload and get things done faster! The U.S. Department of Defence thought this was
        a great idea and experimented a great deal to make this a reality. Soon
        enough we had ARPANET. ARPANET is the internet's grandfather of sorts.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-20">
        How does it work?
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-10">
        The internet is really just many computers connected either directly
        or indirectly to each other. Your computer at home is connected to your
        router at home. Your router is connected to
        a server at your ISP's data center. Your
        ISP has many servers and all its users, like yourself, are connected to
        one of these servers when you connect to the internet. Your ISP is
        probably connected to a bigger ISP and/or its competitors. The bigger ISP is probably
        connected to an even bigger ISP and/or its competitors and so on. And
        just like that all computers connected to the internet are connected
        either directly or indirectly to each other. Google.com is just a computer
        program running on one of Google's servers somewhere. When you visit
        google.com you're really just finding your way through all these different
        computers until you get to it.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        Thinking about how computers connect and talk to each other at the scale
        of the internet is pretty difficult so let's simplify the problem. Let's
        think about how just two computers connect and talk to each other.
        As you know already, computers understand only 1s and 0s. This means
        that we need to somehow get two computers to talk to each other using
        1s and 0s. Let's assume that when you connect two computers together,
        could be via a cable or something like WiFi, they are immediately able
        to exchange 1s and 0s. Great. But this is not very useful.
    </p>

    <h2 class="dark:text-slate-400 mt-20 text-2xl font-bold font-mono">
        Protocols.  
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-10">
        When you speak with someone you would feel quite offended if the other
        person spoke over you. In fact if two people speak at the same time it's
        difficult to comprehend what's actually being said. To avoid such
        confusion we need some rules. We call these rules protocols. The rules
        can be simple like:

        <ul>
            <li>When someone is speaking to you wait for them to finish.</li>
            <li>When you speak make sure not to speak for too long and give the other person a chance to respond.</li>
            <li>Once you're both finished shake hands, smile and wish each other a good day.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        Computers need protocols too to communicate with each other. The first
        protocol that we need is called, aptly, the Internet Protocol or IP. IP
        gives computers names. We call these names IP addresses. Imagine trying to
        speak with someone who doesn't have a name. It would be difficult! IP
        addresses are, you guessed it, 1s and 0s! They're not just any 1s and 0s
        however; there is some structure to them. IP addresses are written
        as four numbers separated by dots, like <b>12.34.56.78</b>. We call each of
        these numbers octets, because each number uses eight bits. And because
        each number uses eight bits each number can only be in the range 0-255.
        What this means is IP addresses range from <b>0.0.0.0</b> to <b>255.255.255.255</b>.
        If someone gives you an IP address and one of the numbers in the IP
        address is not between 0-255 they've made a mistake.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10 bg-slate-600 rounded-lg p-4">
        <i>
            What we discussed above is techincally called IPv4. There is another
            version of IP called IPv6. That is a topic for another time.
        </i>
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        With IP addresses we can now name computers. This allows us to find them.
        When you connect to the internet one of the first things that happen is
        your ISP assigns your computer an IP address. This gives your computer a name
        so that other computers can talk with your computer. Since other computers
        in the network will also have such a name we can begin to communicate with
        them. However just like how conversations are incoherent if there are no
        rules for speech similarly it is difficult to make sense of all the 1s
        and 0s exchanged between computers if there are no rules in place. We
        need another protocol.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-20">
        TCP.
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-10">
        When we speak with another person how do we know they've heard and
        understood what we said? Humans are graced with eyes, a brain, ears, all
        of which can be used to make sense of the world around us. Usually when
        someone has heard and understood what we said they acknowledge it by
        nodding their head, saying "Ok", following up with a question or asking
        you to explain what you mean in case they didn't understand. Computers
        however don't have eyes, ears and a brain like us to know if the another
        computer has received and understood the 1s and 0s sent to them.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        Earlier we have assumed that two computers can be connected and share 1s
        and 0s with each other. Computers can also have names called IP addresses.
        We saw that IP addresses have a structure to them. What if, just hear me
        out, the 1s and 0s that we share with computers also had some kind of
        structure?
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        Have you ever written a letter? I have. Usually you start the
        letter by writing the name of the recipient and their address, followed
        by what you want to say to this person and ending with your own name and
        address. That seems like a good structure. We could do something similar.
        We can begin our letter of 1s and 0s with the IP address of the recipient,
        our own IP address and the size of what we want to say, in bytes.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        "Why do we need to mention the number of bytes in our letter?" you ask.
        Excellent question. Computers are stupid. If we don't mention the size
        of the letter the other computer which receives the letter will not know
        when the letter stops. When we say "the letter is ten bytes long" the other
        computer now knows that the letter ends after ten bytes. All the other 1s
        and 0s it sees now after those ten bytes will be treated as a new letter.
        Great, we have successfully sent a letter from one computer to another.
        Now, when letter writing was all the rage, people immediately became aware of
        an existential dread - how do we know the letter reached and that the other
        person has read it? Over time people unanimously agreed that they should
        respond to the letter with another letter letting the sender know that
        they've received their letter and read it. There were some rude ones out
        there who left the letters on read however.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        Computers don't feel such existential dread. Actually they don't feel
        anything. But I think you would agree that it would be good to know if
        the other computer received the message and understood it. Imagine your
        computer connected to a printer, which is also a computer of sorts, and
        you have no way of knowing if your printer actually understood you want
        it to print when you click the "Print" button. Computer scientists, much
        like letter writing aficionados, agreed that computers should respond
        with an acknowledgement once they've received a message.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        The protocol so far can be summarised as follows:

        <ol>
            <li>Send recipient IP address</li>
            <li>Send your own IP address</li>
            <li>Send size of message in bytes</li>
            <li>Send message</li>
            <li>Wait for acknowledgement</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        The protocol to listen for messages is similar:

        <ol>
            <li>Wait for recipient address</li>
            <li>Wait for senders address</li>
            <li>Wait for size n of message</li>
            <li>Read n bytes as message</li>
            <li>Send acknowledgement</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        If we can agree that a computer should wait for messages when not
        sending messages then we have successfully built a simple communication
        protocol for computers. In the real world however this wouldn't work
        because it's usually more than two computers connected to the network.
        If one computer is sending a very large message it could be that other
        computers have to wait a long time to send their message; networks have
        limited bandwidth. We are nice people and we don't want to keep other
        people waiting so we will make a small change to our protocol. The small
        change is to break our message into small pieces and send these small
        pieces one by one. Like this even if we send a large message we don't
        unnecessarily block someone else's message.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        We call these small pieces packets and give each of them a number in order.
        First packet gets number 1, next packet gets number 2, and so on. Each
        packet will have the recipient IP address, our IP address, the packet's
        number, a small part of the message and the size of that small part of
        the message. We give each packet a number because it is possible for
        packets to get lost and never reach the recipient. If a packet, or two,
        is lost the recipient can respond back saying, "Hey I never received
        packet x. Please resend it." And then you resend it, instead of leaving
        it on read.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-10">
        This was a very unacademic explanation of the Transmission Control
        Protocol or TCP. TCP and IP are more or less the foundation of the
        modern day internet and are usually refered to together as TCP/IP.
