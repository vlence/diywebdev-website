		Welcome!

	<p class="mt-4">
		Hi! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlence/" target="_blank">Victor Basumatary</a> and I build web applications for a
		living. I learned web development through self study, trial and error,
		and I want to share what I've learned over the years with everyone else
		out there who are also interested in learning web development on their
		own.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mt-20">
		Why?
	</h2>

	<p class="mt-4">
		It is my personal opinion that most modern tutorials and courses on web
		development are far too complicated. This website/course is my attempt
		at a simple and straightforward web development course.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mt-20">
		Let's Begin.
	</h2>

	<p class="mt-4">
		A good place to start when learning something is to learn about its
		history: how it came about and why. It's often quite boring in the
		beginning but having this knowledge helps us have the right mindset once
		we begin to explore the problems that web technologies aim to solve.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-4">
		So let's begin. Our first lesson is <a href="/brief-history.html">a brief history of the web</a>.
