    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p class="lead">This website is currently under construction.</p>

    <p>Hi! My name is Victor Basumatary and I build web applications for a living. I learned web development through self study, and trial and error, and I want to share what I've learned over the years with everyone else out there who are also interested in learning web development on their own.</p>

    <h1>Why?</h1>

    <p class="lead">Because I want to challenge myself.</p>

    <p>I feel most college curriculums and online tutorials/courses are lacking. They teach you fundamentals like algorithms and data structures, how to use tools like React, jQuery, databases, and maybe in the end you'll also build a simple eCommerce website or chat application as a project. I don't want to downplay what these courses and curriculums teach you (because they're all important) but I feel that they could be better. Much better.</p>

    <h1>Goal.</h1>

    <p class="lead">A free, easy, and holistic course on web development.</p>

    <p>I have to explain myself a little here - I like to draw a line between a website and a web app. I'm not an academic type so you don't have to use my definitions of these two terms.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Website</b></dt>
      <dd>A website is made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that runs exclusively within a browser context.</dd>

      <dt><b>Web App</b></dt>
      <dd>A software application that runs on remote server(s) on the internet that users may or may not be able to interact with directly.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>I make this distinction because there is a lot of literature out there that uses these two terms interchangeably and in my opinion it just muddies the water when you're trying to learn this stuff.</p>

    <h1>What will I learn?</h1>

    <p class="lead">Web development as I've learned it and am learning it.</p>

    <p>A lot of developers in the web development industry are either "Frontend Engineers" or "Backend Engineers". A few are "Full Stack Developers". I believe it is more empowering for a web developer to understand and be able to implement all components of a solution. This course will NOT focus on tools and technologies as the primary concern of learning but rather the thought process and principles involved in building complete solutions. The learner is encouraged to use supplementary material in their effort to learn web development.</p>

    <h1>Who is this for?</h1>

    <p class="lead">Hopefully, everyone.</p>

    <p>Having some prior programming experience will definitely help you but I want to try and make this course approachable for people with no programming experience as well.</p>
